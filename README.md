# authorcounter
This project creates a classifier using supervised machine learning that predicts the number of authors of an academic article and the year it was written at. The two prediciton functions for the year and number of authors are written. The model to predict year produces more accurate estimations than the model to predict number of authors. 
To exhibit the results, we are working on a TKinter App where people could insert an abstract/a short text, and receive as an output the model prediciton.

Midterm report: 
1. please download the data set from: https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv
2. final_project: this file has all the code we wrote so far, except for the functions;
3. functions: this file contains functions we defined and are used in the general code
4. authorcounter_app: this file is irrelevant for the midterm report. Eventually we would like to have here all the code related to tkinter but for the moment we couldn't bring it to work
