# authorcounter
This project creates a classifier using supervised machine learning that predicts the number of authors of an academic article and the year it was written at. The two prediciton functions for the year and number of authors are written. The model to predict year produces more accurate estimations than the model to predict number of authors. 
To exhibit the results, we are working on a TKinter App where people could insert an abstract/a short text, and receive as an output the model prediciton.
